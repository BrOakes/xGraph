# Genesis

v1.1.1

Introspective Systems, LLC.

---
## Genesis.js
The Genesis.js script file is the compiler for an xGraph System. When run, the
script will build an xGraph cache directory from an xGraph config.json file.
If a cache exists in the same path as the destination for the new built it will
be deleted prior to removal. --Remember: Genesis will compile a system from the
config file and thus all saved data from previously run systems will be lost.


## Getting Started

Clone the xGraph Git repository for access to the Genesis.js source code or
download the system dependent installer from the Introspective Systems webpage.
The installer will wrap the file in the xgraph executable.
