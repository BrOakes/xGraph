#### Hello!

This is the HelloWorld system. When run, this system will wait for user
input through the console, echo what the user says and increment a
counter.

For detailed information on xGraph systems, see our
[Systems Guide](https://github.com/IntrospectiveSystems/xGraph/wiki/1.2-Systems-Guide).

This system consists of one module, the HelloWorld module. The HelloWorld
module handles the systems functionality. HelloWorld is built to print
a welcome message to the user, wait for user input, repeat what the user
said, and increment a counter.
