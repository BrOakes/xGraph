# NeDB Wrapper

This module is a wrapper for the npm package NeDB, located [here](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb).

### Getting started

NeDB Takes only one Par, `Filename`, which is where the database will be stored or loaded from if it already exists.

Ex:

```json
{
	"NeDB": {
		"Module": "Modules.NeDB",
		"Par": {
			"Filename": "database.nedb"
		}
	}
}
```

The Command API can be found on the docs [here](thedocs.com)
