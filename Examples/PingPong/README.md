### PingPong System

---
#### Description

This is the **PingPong** system. This system is an example of how modules
can work together in a system.

The **Ping** module sends a `"Ping"` command to the **Pong** module. Then,
Pong sends a *`Pong`* command to the Ping module. This shows how to connect
modules in a system and how modules can send commands back and fort.
