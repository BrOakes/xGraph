# Nexus

v1.1.1

Introspective Systems, LLC.

---
## Nexus.js
The Nexus.js script file is the kernel for an xGraph System. When run, the
script will instantiate an xGraph System from an xGraph cache directory. If a
cache doesn't exists in the directed path Genesis.js (the compiler) will first
build a cache directory before Nexus proceeds with the startup process.


## Getting Started

Clone the xGraph Git repository for access to the Nexus.js source code or
download the system dependent installer from the Introspective Systems webpage.
The installer will wrap the file in the xgraph executable.
